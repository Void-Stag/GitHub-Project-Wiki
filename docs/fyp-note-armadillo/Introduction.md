# Introduction

For my Final Year Project @ university, I chose to develop a note taking web app with:
- **Flask**
- **SQLite**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Python**


As part of the Flask framework, there are several packages utilised to build and bridge the UI and Database together. The most notable packages are:
- **Jinja2**
- **Werkzug**
